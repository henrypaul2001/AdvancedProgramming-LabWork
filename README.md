# AdvancedProgramming-LabWork

An exploration of C++ as a langauge and its relationship with system memory and the underlying assembly code.

This assignment was structured as a series of weekly lab entries which would be discussed the following week in person with a mark awarded on that day. This all lead to a final, much more substantial lab exercise that would contribute the most to the overall grade of the module.

I achieved a grade of 95%, my highest grade!

# Week 3 - Functions and filestreams
- Command arguments
- Copying a text file using filestreams
- Function calls and the disassembler

# Week 4 - Classes and pointers
- Linker errors
- Load a file into a grid class
- Save a grid class to a file
- Pointers
- Pointers to pointers
- Pointer chains

# Week 5 - Auxiliary operators and return values
- Using auxiliary operators in a fraction class
- Pass by value vs pass by reference
- Return by value vs return by reference

# Week 6 - Recursion and template classes
- Template grid class
- Binary search

# Week 7 - Parasoft
- Using parasoft tests

# Week 8 - Linked lists
- Address book single linked list
- Find, delete, output methods for linked list

# Final lab - Wordsearch solver
Implement alternate data structures and solving algorithms for wordsearch puzzles, report on their operational efficiency.

I used a combination of the simple puzzle structure and simple dictionary to compare with a combination of the advanced puzzle structure and simple dictionary.

Different text files are provided for different sizes of wordsearch and a list of words in the grid. Once the program has solved the puzzle, it will output the words it found and the words it didn't find, along with other statistics such as the number of grid cells it visited, number of dictionary entries it visited, time to populate the grid structure and the time to solve the puzzle.

Using these values, the implementations could be compared.
